  + intro: "The present paper is intended as a contribution toward meeting this need. Part I is an index, according to country or area, of estimates of elasticities iand propensities taken from 42 books and articles pub- lished in the period 1937 to 1957. These sources are described in Part II. The numbers in parentheses-e.g., exports of food (30), (31), under United Kingdom-in Part I, are references to the sources given in Part II for the estimated elasticities or propensities related to the topic.' Each description in Part II sets forth the purpose and scope of the study, the variables and the methods used in the statistical  tion, the tests of significance used (if any), and the conclusions drawn by the author. A quick look at these notes may help the reader to decide whether a study is likely to give him the information that will be usefulto him." (pg 1-2)

  + intro: This paper presents an econometric model of bilateral trade flows for ten !Vest European countries from 1953 to 1968. Our aim is to develop and estimate a trade model which yields a reasonable set of direct and indirect price effects while endeavoring to avoid the problem of multicollinearity of price. The structure and estimates of such a model allow us to explore the implications of differential price changes or discriminatory tariff changes for the trade of the countries included in the model. A second paper by the authors (Resnick and Truman, 1973) presents these policy results. If the model were :xpanded to include at least the United States, Canada and Japan as separate importers and sources of supply, it might be useful in analy; ing the effects of exchange rate changes.

  + "This paper uses empirical evidence to examine the proposition advanced by Lawrence B. Krause that the establishment of the Common Market will seriously harm U.S. exports because "dominant suppliers"1 in EEC countriesreceive increased protection from the averaging of national tariffs [1] r6]. Subsequently, the results are used to reinterpret the traditional conclusions regarding the effects of tariff reductions on the domestic economy, and additional tests are offered to indicate the predominance of intraindustry-as against interindustry-specialization in trade in manufactures among the industrial countries."

  + "An increase in per capita income in a country is normally accompanied by a rise in the share of industrial output. The accepted explanation for this relationship is the change in the composition of demand,of which the decline in the share of food (Engel's Law) is the most not-able feature. However, this over-all relationship does not necessarilyapply to every individual country. XVithin limits, the changing composition of domestic demand can be offset through foreign trade. A coun-try having a continuing comparative advantage in primary productionmay therefore reach a high level of income without an increase in theshare of industry in total output. Because of the diversity of naturalresources, we should not expect to find uniform patterns of growth inall countries.'Evidence from several sources suggests a closer and more pronouncedrelationship between levels of income and industrial output than wouldbe predicted from the change in demand alone. Kuznets' comparisonof some 50 countries [13] shows a marked increase of manufacturingwith rising per capita income, as did the earlier analyses of Bean[1] and Clark [2]. The fact that patterns of trade change systematically with rising income levels is equally well established [9]. Historical studies also show considerable uniformity in the rise of industry as growth proceeds [7] [10] [15]. Finally, modern growth theory contains arguments against continued specialization in primary production, stemming from the uncertainty of export demand and the interdependence among sectors of production [14] [16]."

  + "AT the 1960-61 GATT tariff conference (The Dillon Round) the United States negotiated with the European Economic Community and 11 otherdeveloped countries (DC) as well as with six less developed countries (LDC)(Cambodia, Haiti, India, Israel, Pakistan and Peru) and agreed to reduce its duties on products covering some $2 billion of imports in 1960. While this 20 % reduction of tariffs on some 20 % of dutiable imports was small compared with the 35 % cut on almost 55 % of dutiable imports achieved in the more recent Kennedy Round, they were more extensive, both in terms of the magnitude of the reductions and extent of import coverage, than the reductions achieved in any of the previous five GATT rounds except the first,in Geneva in 1947.

  + intro: For the past 25 years the United States has been granting tariff concessions to foreign nations under authority provided by the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. Negotiations leading to these concessions were conducted on a bilateral basis during the prewar years, and shifted to the multilateral framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947. But throughout the entire period they were subject to the unconditional most favored nation principle under which a concession granted to any one country is immediately applicable to all other sources of supply. In total, these concessions had a sizeable effect on the United States tariff level, reducing the ratio1 of duties collected to the value of dutiable imports by 50 percent between 1933 and 1953:Concessions made in all trade agreements apply to articles which accounted for 93.4 per cent of the total dutiable imports in 1952.... Theaverage ad valorem equivalent of the duties on total dutiable imports (weighted by 1952 data) before any trade agreements were in effect was 24.4 per cent. The average at January 1, 1945, rates was 17.9 per cent; and as of January 1, 1953, it was 12.2 per cent [17, p. 3]. Although overshadowed by the substantial rise in income during the past generation, such a large decline in the level of protection could not fail to have some effect on the volume of U.S. imports. This article utilizes data from the two most recent GATT negotiations, conducted in 1955 and 1956, to examine the effect of the United States tariff-reduction program on the prices and volume of imports subject to tariff concessions. After comparing the results to those obtained by other students of the subject, the data are used to draw policy conclusions and to measure roughly the gain in welfare and the loss of employment resulting from the tariff cuts."

  +main point of intro "The intent of this paper is to estimate a model of international trade and to use that model to construct tariff averages. In section 1 we shall describe a fairly complete trade dependence model that includes tariffs and that allows tariff elasticities to vary from commodity to commodity. The model is estimated using cross-section 1958 data and the results are reported in section 2. These estimates are used in section 3 to compute ahandful of different tariff averages and corresponding elasticity averages. Section 4 contains brief concluding remarks."

  + "CANADA was one of 52 countries participating in the "Kennedy Round" negotiations of 1964-1967. Because of the openness of the Canadian economy, the potential results of these trade liberalizations on its imports and exports are of special interest.' In this study we forecast the price effects of the Kennedy Round on Canada's trade as of 1973, when all the negotiated tariff reductions are scheduled to have occurred. We consider the impacts on total Canadian imports and exports to the United States, and analyze them disaggrega- tively by commodity groups. This is done by means of a four-stage procedure: 1) Develop time series of trade, price, and activity that are useful, indeed essential, for any systematic examination of Canadian trade.2 2) Estimate demand functions for Canadian imports and exports, using as data the series obtained in (1). 3) Construct tariff rates for the commodity groups in (2) on pre-Kennedy (pre-1968) and post-Kennedy (post-1972) bases. 4) Deduce the price effects of the Kennedy Round by the application of the tariff rates in (3) to the demand functions in (2). In section II we discuss the specification and estimation of the demand functions. We present estimated equations for Canadian imports in section III and for exports to the United States in section IV. These equations and some especially constructed data are applied to calculate the effects of the Kennedy Round in section V."

Estimation of the Parameters of the Model. - V. On the Values of the Parameters. - VI. Discussion of the Results. paper aims to bring some structural features of international trade into relief. The analysis is based on the simultaneous appli- cation of a structural and explanatory model resembling an input- output model to the exchange of goods between ten European countries in 1958. The nature of the experiment made it necessary to confine the analysis at this stage to a relatively limited set of data, but there is nothing, in principle, to prevent the extension of the analysis to the world trade as a whole. Changes over time were also left outside the scope of this paper, so that the model employed is static. In spite of these restrictions the results are of interest and, as I believe, novel; they serve to indicate that the bilateral approach can be abandoned in investigating international trade, which can be treated as an integral whole within the framework of a single model or model system

  +"This model is applicable to the flow of any kind of quantifiable trans- actions, and to matrices from three to more than one hundred actors, utilizing a 650 IBM electronic computer or similar equipment. The method develops a matrix of expected or baseline data from assumptions of complete indifference among the actors, and measures the plus or minus differences between this baseline value and the actual amount of transactions in each direction for every pair of actors. It thus removes gross size effects and permits tentative inferences about the distribution of preferences among pairs of larger groups of actors; about degrees of clustering or integration among actors; and about changes over time, if several matrices are used. It thus locates interesting pairs or groups for further study. Import-export data are used as an example to show the detailed application of the method. For a given year and a group of countries, the import- export data can be arranged like a contingency table, except the diagonal cells are zero and the other entries are quantities of money, a continuous variable instead of a discrete variable. A model describing the data and techniques for the statistical analysis are presented. This is a "null model" in the sense that the departures from it are of primary interest. The North Atlantic Area (1928) is used as an illustration."
  + Comment: it is 1928 but can be used to apply to later models.
